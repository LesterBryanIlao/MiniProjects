	The SupereMesh Calculator enables the user to obtain the mesh currents in a circuit using the
Super Mesh Circuit analysis. The application suggests 3 different circuits namely "Example 1", "Example
2" and "Example 3", to be filled by the user. In each example, the user can type-in the number of their 
choice in order to assign the values of each component on their chosen circuit example.
 
	In inserting values, the "Component" part is divided to 4 parts, Real part (Re), Real part 
multiplier, Imaginary part (Im), and Real part multiplier. On the other hand, the "Source" part have only
2 parts, the Source value and Source Multiplier. Only numbers, a decimal or negative sign are allowed 
to be inserted on Real part (Re),Imaginary part (Im), and Source Value. Other values may cause notice
error on the application saying "Invalid Values, try again" and automated deletion of the invalid part 
which is needed to fill up again. Each part has its multipler which enables the user to easily multily 
a value by a mutiply of 10 in an engineering notation. After plugging-in the wanted values, the user 
should press "Evaluate" button. The given values will be shown on the circuit with its corresponding 
complex number values in its rectangular form. In addition, the magnitude and phase and angle of the  
resulting mesh currents will also be displayed on the application

	The user may leave blank or insert 0 on the Real part (Re) if a component has no real part
as well as on the Imaginary part (Im) if the component has no imaginary part. Leaving the Component Part 
or Source Part leave will cause the application not to show results as it is required on the circuit.

	That's all and enjoy using the SuperMesh Calculator.
